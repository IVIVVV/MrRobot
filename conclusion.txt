This was not a realistic website but a base to an understanding of how things should go 

I learned some basic enumeration like robots.txt. After i was finished with this VM i 
looked up a few walkthrough of many others and i found out that you can guess the 
user name was "eliot" through some research related to "mr.robots" which was the name 
of the VM. I also realize brute forcing is not as powerful as i thought without a 
proper wordlist, in this challange they just gave us the wordlist and make the job 
so much easier(that is why i said this VM is not realistic).
